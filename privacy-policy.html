      <h3 class="subtitle">Information Collection and Processing</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">We do not collect or store any information that users enter into this application. Generated passwords are stored on the user’s own device clipboard and are never sent to us. User entries into input fields for Nicknames and Master Passwords are not stored at all. We do not intentionally collect any personally identifiable information (such as name, email address, phone number, etc.) and users are not required to provide us with any such information in order to use this app. Users may choose to provide the company with personally identifiable information if they contact us with questions or support requests.</p>

      <h3 class="subtitle">Enquiry Information Collection</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">In response to support requests or other communications initiated by users, we will collect your name, the content of your message, as well as the email address or other contact information to which we will direct our response. Support requests may be submitted via email to info@vermonster.com. Since this project is open source on Github, users may also submit issues or pull requests there.</p>

      <h3 class="subtitle">Purpose of Processing</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">We only process users’ personal information from enquiries in order to respond to your request and maintain a record of your past communication with the company. We may use this information to follow up, particularly in the case of support requests.</p>

      <h3 class="subtitle">Legal Basis for Processing</h3>

      <h3 class="subtitle">Sharing Your Information</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">We do not share or sell your personal information to any third-party.
